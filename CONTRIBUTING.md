# Here's how you can contribute

First of all, thanks for your interest. Together with you, we can
make this project the best it can be! When asking for help, we
gladly assist. However, please refrain from being a [Help
Vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/).

## `pre-commit`

`pre-commit` is used to enforce conventions, both locally and
through CI. To avoid failed CI actions, ensure that you enable
`pre-commit` before you make any pull requests. The following
should suffice:
```sh
pre-commit install
```
If you're doing alterations to the `pre-commit` hooks themselves,
please run:
```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
That's what we're running in CI as well.
